## **DESCRIPTION:-**
<p align="justify">
In this I am creating an IAM user and implemnting an policy that will granting the access to the EC2 and deny the access to the s3 for the first part of the task. for the second part of the task Not only will that IAM user I created be blocked, but I'm also going to make sure no one can access the files by blocking the public access. That's double-layered security â€“ keeping both specific users and the general public out. For the third part of my task which is encription For S3, I'm enabling server-side encryption to protect the data at rest.  And on my EC2 instance, I'm adding a KMS key to encrypt the instance volume.  That way, even if someone were to somehow get access to the storage, the data would still be unreadable without the key.  It's all about making sure that even if one layer of defense falls, there are still more in place.
